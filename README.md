Tutorial:

Welcome to the Renderly Tutorial! Today we will learn how to use Renderly, the C# OpenTK Library!
Note, this will NOT teach you how to install Renderly.

First, head to the Program.cs inside Source! This is our main script we use to run the code.
You should see a void called RunRenderly, inside here will showcase all the voids used in Renderly! (or most)

CreateButton();
This void is for creating buttons (or basic squares). You first have to input the position into a vector2, followed by the size, and Color.

SetWindowColor();
This void sets the Window to your desired color from our Colors Namespace! Pretty self explained.

CreateWindow();
This void creates and runs the window with your desired code.
We have 2 ints, the window's width and height. You can assign them, then the Title is for the windows name.

Enjoy using Renderly!!!
